# ðŸ§¾ BudgetSync Internal Technical Documentation

## Overview

**BudgetSync** is a Flask-based budgeting application developed as a capstone project. It allows users to manage income, track expenses, and simulate tax withholding. The project emphasizes secure authentication, modular budgeting, and simple data integration. To meet the capstoneâ€™s API requirement, a weather API was added to the dashboard. A full-featured tax API was planned but is currently archived; instead, a generic placeholder tax calculation is used for now.

## 1. Application Architecture

- **Flask**: Web framework
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary data store
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM layer
- **Redis**: Session management
- **SendGrid**: Email delivery (password reset)
- **OpenWeatherMap**: Weather integration
- **itsdangerous**: Token generation for password reset
- **Flask-Login** / **Flask-Session** / **Flask-Bcrypt**: Core auth stack

---

## 2. Feature Summary

### âœ… Core Features Implemented
- Secure user registration and login
- Profile management (tax info, benefits, employment)
- Budget creation and editing
- Income frequency normalization
- Expense categorization (min/preferred payments)
- Basic tax withholding estimation (non-API)
- Weather API integration (external)
- Flash messaging and validation

### ðŸš§ In Progress or Needs Improvement
- Budget preview and navigation flow
- Tax summary logic on budget pages
- Edit budget from dashboard
- Transitions between input stages
- Inline help/tooltips
- Visualization components (e.g., tax burden chart)

---

## 3. Authentication & Session Management

- Passwords hashed using **Flask-Bcrypt**
- Sessions managed using **Flask-Session** backed by Redis
- Login handled with **Flask-Login**
- All protected routes redirect unauthorized users to login
- Password reset flow uses `itsdangerous` for secure token generation and SendGrid for email delivery
- User profile completion is mandatory before creating a budget

## 4. Tax Calculation Logic (Generic, Not API-Driven)

### Background:
Originally, the plan was to implement a custom tax API with proper endpoints and dynamic logic. However, due to time constraints, the tax API was archived. A **non-realistic, generic tax calculation module** was developed to simulate withholding and support budgeting logic.

### Current Implementation:
- Purely internal; not exposed via API
- No actual tax bracket logic â€” fixed calculations only
- Accepts basic profile inputs (e.g., income, dependents, withholdings)

### Behavior:
- Runs behind the scenes when calculating a budget
- Does not reflect accurate IRS, FICA, or state-level tax rules
- No real projection or withholding tables

### Future Direction:
- Replace with dynamic internal module or connect to public tax datasets
- Include tax visualization and breakdown (planned)

---

## 5. Weather API Integration (External API)

### Purpose:
To fulfill the bootcampâ€™s requirement for an API integration, the OpenWeatherMap API was added to the dashboard. This replaced an abandoned plan to develop a custom tax API due to time constraints.

### Route:
POST /weather/weather

### Parameters:
- city: City name (e.g., "Tampa")
- state: Two-letter U.S. state abbreviation (e.g., "FL")
- country: Country code (e.g., "US")

### Output:
- JSON response includes:
  - Temperature
  - Weather condition (e.g., "Cloudy", "Sunny")
  - Humidity
  - Wind speed

### Notes:
- API key must be set as `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` in `.env`
- Integration is read-only (weather data is not stored)
- No retry, fallback, or caching logic implemented
- Minimal user feedback on API failure (future improvement needed)

## 6. Budget Creation Workflow

### Step-by-Step:
1. User Registration & Login
2. Complete Profile: Includes income type, frequency, deductions, etc.
3. Create Budget from dashboard
4. Input Income Sources: Each with its own frequency (weekly, monthly, etc.)
5. Normalize Income to monthly values
6. Input Expense Items: Includes min/preferred payments
7. Apply Basic Tax Estimate (generic logic)
8. Store Budget in database with status `draft` or `final`

---

## 7. Income Normalization Logic

| Frequency | Formula Used     |
|-----------|------------------|
| Weekly    | amount Ã· 52      |
| Biweekly  | amount Ã· 26 x 2  |
| Monthly   | amount Ã· 12          |

- Gross annual income is collected as input from the user.
- Normalized monthly income is summed from all sources.
- Tax estimate and deductions are applied to this figure to simulate net income.

---

## 8. Flash Messaging System

### Categories Used:
- `success`: Positive confirmation (e.g., "Budget created")
- `error`: Validation or system error
- `info`: Guidance messages

### Status:
- Flash messages now rendered globally via `base.html`
- Minor bug fixed where messages were delayed
- Still needs improved wording and conditional logic

## 9. Outstanding Bugs and Backlog (as of April 2025)

| Area             | Description                                            |Status
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Budget Routing   | Budget creation skips category selection page          |Category selection page added |
| Budget Edit      | Edit form does not pre-fill or retain changes          |Edit form works as intended |
| Preview Budget   | Does not render calculated budget summary              |Calculation logic updated to render proper numbers |
| Flash UX         | Messages sometimes inaccurate or redundant             |Messaging was in the wrong location.  Been updated to the appropriate template location in the base file. |
| Weather API      | No fallback or graceful error handling                 |
| Generic Tax Logic| Not connected to all relevant profile fields           |

## 10. Planned Enhancements

- Add tax visualization to budget preview
- Support state-specific tax rules
- Introduce debt payoff planner (snowball method)
- Export annual budget summary to PDF
- Add mobile-responsive views
- Add admin dashboard for managing users and budgets
- Integrate caching for API responses

---

## 11. Archived Tax API (Background)

- The original intent was to build a fully functional internal tax API.
- This was shelved due to project time constraints.
- Codebase exists in an `/archive/` directory with partial logic and endpoints.
- It may be developed post-capstone for real tax forecasting and comparison.

---

## 12. Environment Configuration

`.env` file must include:
- `FLASK_ENV=development`
- `FLASK_DEBUG=1`
- `SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key`
- `DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://user:pass@localhost:5432/dbname`
- `REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0`
- `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key`
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key`

---

## 13. Testing and Debugging

### Current Status:
- Manual testing performed for major flows
- No automated tests implemented yet

### Testing Goals:
- Unit tests for income normalization and budget logic
- Flash message testing
- Simulated API failure handling for weather requests
- Password reset and session timeout tests

## 14. Project Conclusion

**BudgetSync** is a functional capstone-level financial planning tool. It demonstrates core backend engineering principles including authentication, budgeting logic, ORM modeling, and API integration.

The current system lays the groundwork for future expansion, including:
- Real tax computation
- Debt management
- Secure production deployment
- Scalable architecture for professional use

This concludes the internal documentation from Section 5 to Section 14.
