# Detailed Plan

=========================================================

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è 5. External Integrations

- **dbdiagram.io** (for visualizing schema from SQL or ORM)
- **Quarto or MkDocs** (if you publish docs)

---

## ‚úÖ Immediate Next Steps

1. Copy this plan into a `docs/_README_BACKDOC_PLAN.md` file.
2. Choose one section (e.g., `auth_flow.md`) and backfill based on your current codebase.
3. Gradually fill each doc as you refactor or finalize production deployment.
